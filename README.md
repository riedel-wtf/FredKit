# FredKit

A collection of customised Swift extensions and classes I've written over the years which might be useful for others as well. I use Swift classes such as the Date extension and rounded buttons in almost every project nowadays.

## Rounded Buttons
- Specify corner radius
- Uses advanced continous corners instead of perfectly round corners

## TimeIntervals and Date Formatting


## Working with Colors
- Contrast calculation (dark or light background required for a font with specific color?)
- Generate color from string

## Rounded Font
- Creates the rounded SF font version

## Simplified Localized String
Use `NSLocalizedString("hello world!")` without the additional `comment` attribute.

## Strings
- Capitalize first character of a string
- SHA1 hash
- Is string almost equal to other string?
- Subscript (get `char` at index)
- Levenshtein distance
- Get CGPath of String


## FileManager extensions
- Ensure folder exists


## UIView
- snapshot `UIView`
